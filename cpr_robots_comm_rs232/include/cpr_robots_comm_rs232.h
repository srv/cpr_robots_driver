* The USB2CAN bridge is an interface to connect a PC via USB to a CAN field bus.

* It sends received CAN messages as 10 char messages to the PC.
* The PC sends CAN messages as 10 char messages to the bridge, the bridge forwards it to the CAN bus.

* The standard port is defined as /dev/ttyUSB0
* If the CAN bridge connects on another port this has to be corrected in the .cpp file
* Baud rates: 115.200 in the serial line, 500 kb/s on the CAN
